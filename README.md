# Multi-modal-_AI-project
This Multimodal AI project integrates multiple types of data inputs—such as text, images, and audio—to enable more intelligent, context-aware, and human-like understanding and decision-making. Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on a single data modality multimodal AI mimics how humans interpret the world through multiple senses.
